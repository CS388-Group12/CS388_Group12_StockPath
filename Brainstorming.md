App Idea Brainstorming: 


1) Stock Portfolio Management Tool App
2) Social Network App 
3) Vacation Planning and Booking App

App Idea Evaluations:
A stock portfolio management tool app: So far our favorite app idea so far is a stock portfolio management tool where we can access the Yahoo Finance API for current and historical data. Then in the app users can state their holdings, positions and set targets and alerts for events. It could also calculate the users current market portfolio value as the worth of their total portfolio changes every second cumulatively. This app would require accessing an api and handling data and comparing financial data with user input, in which events would trigger alerts and notifications. We would also need to store data on a database for user acconts or locally on the device. Also we could potentially show kline data for charts visually using a ploting library.

## Conclusion
StockPath, the stock portfolio management tool is ourtop app idea because it would allow users to track their holdings, positions, and overall portfolio value in real time. By integrating an open data API such as the Yahoo Finance API, the app can pull in current and historical market data, making it easier for users to monitor their investments. Users can set alerts based on price or percentage changes and get notified when key events happen. The app would also handle profit calculations behind the scenes and store data either locally or in a database for user accounts. Additionally, we could include kline charts using a plotting library to give users a clear visual representation of market trends.
