## Overview

### Description

StockPath, the stock portfolio management tool is ourtop app idea because it would allow users to track their holdings, positions, and overall portfolio value in real time. By integrating an open data API such as the Yahoo Finance API, the app can pull in current and historical market data, making it easier for users to monitor their investments. Users can set alerts based on price or percentage changes and get notified when key events happen. The app would also handle profit calculations behind the scenes and store data either locally or in a database for user accounts. Additionally, we could include kline charts using a plotting library to give users a clear visual representation of market trends.
